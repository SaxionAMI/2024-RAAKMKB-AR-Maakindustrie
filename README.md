Developed and tested using python 3.10.

To use, first install all dependencies:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the program with a simple user interface using

	python video2instruction_UI.py

UI settings are saved in the user's root folder in the file video2instruction_settings.cfg

To run without user interface, change the `main()` function in `process_video.py` and run

	python process_video.py
